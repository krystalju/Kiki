I’m an entry-level IT Support Engineer helping people solve everyday tech problems.
I handle user tickets, fix hardware glitches, and make sure everyone’s laptops stay healthy.

Learning PowerShell scripts to automate routine tasks like software installs and updates.
I love solving puzzles and explaining tech in simple words.

My goal is to grow into a Systems Administrator role.
